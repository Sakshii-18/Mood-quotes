# Mood Quotes

Mood Quotes is a simple web-based project where users can select their mood and receive a matching motivational quote.

## About the Project

This is one of my first mini projects. It was created using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to understand:
- DOM manipulation
- Event handling in JavaScript
- File organization for web development
- Publishing with GitHub Pages

## Features

- Multiple mood options (Happy, Sad, Tired, etc.)
- Random quote shown based on selected mood
- Simple and clean user interface
- Hosted live using GitHub Pages

## Live Demo
